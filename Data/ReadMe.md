# Data

- Carbon assimilation rates for each phytometer along the photosynthesis-irradiance curve calculated using a CIRAS-3
- Naming convention: 
    - phytometers with "CU" were grown without competition
    - P = Phragmites australis
    - CAP = Carex aquatilis
    - CCP = Calamagrostis canadensis
    - TYP = Typha spp. (Typha X glauca hybrid)
    - Data was collected over the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017
    - Phytometers were paired at the beginning of the growing season (same number in ID) though not every phytometer survived
