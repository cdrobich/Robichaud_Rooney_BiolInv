# Differences in above-ground resource acquisition and niche overlap between a model invader (Phragmites australis) and resident plant species: Measuring the role of fitness and niche differences in the field


Code for light response curves for Robichaud and Rooney (Biological Invasions)

- `Data` contains carbon assimilation rates for each phytometer at different measures of PAR (1500, 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 0) 
- `Script` contains the light response curves, light compensation point and light saturation point calculations obtained from Heberling et al. 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plx011). Loop to generate results was written by Jody Daniel (https://jodyndaniel.wixsite.com/website)
